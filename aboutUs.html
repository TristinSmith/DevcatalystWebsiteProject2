      <strong>December, 2008:</strong> Our founder, Jacob Stevens, grew tired of
      the price for 3D printed goods; due to this, Jacob vowed to make a company
      to create and ship affodable printed goods. He bought a 3D printer and
      began to operate locally.

      <strong>March, 2009:</strong> Jacob and a group of friends decided to
      start D³ in one of their garages. They increased production greatly,
      allowing the company to operate across the entire county and bordering
      regions of neighboring counties.

      <strong>July, 2010:</strong> The group bought a warehouse in order to
      facilitate their 3D printing needs. Despite facing many harships and the
      Legal System, D³ began to expand rapidly.
