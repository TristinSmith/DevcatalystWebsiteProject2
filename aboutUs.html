      <p>
        <strong>December, 2008:</strong><br />
        Our founder, Jacob Stevens, grew tired of the price for 3D printed
        goods; due to this, Jacob vowed to make a company to create and ship
        affordable printed goods. He bought a 3D printer and began to operate
        locally.

        The first purchase of D続 occurred soon after the company began production
        of products. Within the span of a few weeks, Jacob had sold 100 3D
        printed goods to his local community. Realizing how much people loved
        custom-made 3D printed objects, Jacob set his sights on creating an
        empire specifically for selling goods.

        Jacob and a group of friends decided to start D続 officially in one of
        their garages. They increased production greatly, allowing the company
        to operate across the entire county and bordering regions of neighboring
        counties.

        needs. Despite facing many hardships and the Legal System, D続 began to
        expand rapidly.
